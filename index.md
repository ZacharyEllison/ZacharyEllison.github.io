# About
Zachary Ellison is a minimalist with too many things, attentive (_deficit_), father of three; alum of Harvard University. 
He even got out of bed this morning.

 Once out of bed, he continues on his path of **fatherhood**, **learning**, and **creating things he enjoys**.

## Key Attributes
* Bakes an incredible loaf of bread
* Often awake
* Studied Computer Science

## Getting Started

I am rebuilding this site _again_ since I stopped in 2018, using the [cvless](https://github.com/piazzai/cvless) jekyll theme and [github pages](https://pages.github.com/)

This time, the difference is in the soul purpose. Before, I thought I needed to. Now, I **want** to. I plan to use this platform for presenting things I write.
