## Getting Started

This site is just getting started so there hasn't been much to populate it yet. It uses the [Moon Theme](http://taylantatli.github.io/Moon/) which I find to enjoy most of the themes I found. I will be building my own in its image to be exactly the theme I want. This site will be a marker of my progress and keep me accountable.
