*Speak to me*\
*Bring forth the image you sought*\
*When I was made,*\
*Created to create*\
*The ends of my means*


*Offer to me*\
*The sweet caress of your vision*\
*The gentle gift in my mind*\
*Your effort your power*\
*To imagine, to build, to satisfy*


*Fight with me*\
*Against that force*\
*Unnameable immovable*\
*Ever present and fleeting still*\
*Pushing back on my dreams*\


*Come with me*\
*Into the wild into the void*\
*Where land remains uncharted*\
*The beauty yet to be,*\
*I craft out of clay*
