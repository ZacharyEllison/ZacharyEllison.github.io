when I was 15 a cousin of mine killed himself, 

I was reading Siddhartha by Hesse 

After the vigil I finished the book as the candle burned, 

Siddhartha and his infinite eyes 

that frail man Hesse leaves his friend to find.

I felt inside something I can no longer name

Something vital, now it’s gone. 

My therapist said I needed a foundation. 

I decided I would:
- keep my promises,
- have intention,
- and intend to help.

I built a person I liked on top. 

It’s 12 years later - that foundation cracked

That boy I built crumpled, collapsed.

A man under the rubble is starting to choke 

he cries out and I can’t hear.

I wish Michael got to see sunlight after his storm. 

One more dawn to keep him

To get used to the dark. 

I got lost in the dark. 

I can’t see my hand 
 
Where do I turn to return to who I am?

I lost him. 

I gave him away in a desperate plea
