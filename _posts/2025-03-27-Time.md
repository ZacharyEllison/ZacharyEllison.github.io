Time to go\
Time to stay\
Time for _you_ to _go away_\

Time for this\
Time for that;\
How 'bout time to take a nap?\

_I have no time!_\
Some time next week?\
I'm out of time to feel complete.\

Just in time to start the day.\
Time's running out, so don't delay!\

Where did the time go?\
Or has the time come?\
We'll make the time then we'll be done.\ 

Alone Time\
Free time\
Precious Time\
Me Time\

Family Time\
Play time\
Dinner Time\
_Any time_\

Time moves fast\
Time goes slowly\
Remember to treat your time as _holy_\

Or time is money\
now aint that funny?\
Time is money?\
Might as well say\
that time is honey\
or call it a bunny -\

When Time is lost,\
where is Her body?\

She's in the river, the sky, the air-\
Time is lord\
Time is heir\

Her throne stands tall\
Watching all\
for all of time\

The beginning of time\
is just past its end.\

And we meet here, where we make the time bend.\
