# Self-Confidence

Self confidence is the concept of being enough, trusting yourself, and knowing what your strengths are.
I think it's also acknowledging areas of growth that needs to be.

I was having a conversation with peers at work [[2024-06-03]]. I was trolling the channels to catch up on what might have happened over the weekend. I saw a thread on a metabase query from a name I recognized, A, and I clicked the link because I realized I was curious.


I hop on and the initial engineer to help, B, says 
> "what is that on your head!" 
I was working in VR and so it was my webcam left on with me in my quest 3. He replies
> We're at work but I wanna say a lot of out of pocket comments 


I then went on to solve the issue for A while B was looking at it by checking the github pull requests. Then I posted in the slack thread the conversation we had about the PR - apparently so well the next person to ask a similar question tagged me instead of B. 

I don't think I'm offended and I don't believe I should be because I believe he meant well

But I am confused. And maybe that's because I'm autistic? But ultimately I just wanted to examine the interaction.


#### Positives

- I think it's a good practice of my ability to shrug off criticism and 
- also my ability to perform under scrutiny.
- I also think I'm at least a little charming. so the two guys weren't angry and that appeases my anxiety
#### Takeaways

I think I could have asked for clarification, but I do shy away from even gentle confrontation
