## Zachary Ellison Homepage
---------------------
This is the homepage for my portfolio and blog.  
  This is the very beginning of the project, and there isn't a clear trajectory as of yet where this will go.
  
### _Goals_

  * Blog to follow progress along
    * FreeCodeCamp
    * Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp
    * CS121 Self study background course
    * Javascript 30
    * Other programs like one for C, etc.
  * Portfolio for projects I will build
    * _likely removing the two games that are presently in my repos_
  * Resume to present to potential employers
  * Design my own theme for the site
    * Figuring out exactly what Github Pages can and can't do for hosting
    * Designing a single column and fresh personal site
    
 #### _Theme_
 
 Though I plan to create my own theme, at present I am using [Moon by Taylin Tatli][moon link]. 
 I have forked the original but plan to incrementally change everything. 
 This is in hopes to make me learn more about it all.  


 ###### _Contact_
 
 Feel free to contact me by [email](zach.r.ellison@gmail.com).  

 Eventually I'll get (_or rather use what I already have_) social media like twitter but I can't be bothered right now.
 You can find them on the [homepage](zellison.me).
